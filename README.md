Current release is **v0.75**


This MaxScript is for manipulate arch and design materials in the scene. At the moment it is limited to 90 materials, this you can change at your own risk (maybe on some computers it works with 200 materials).

For using it, go in 3Ds Max under MaxScript: Run Script... and select the script file. 
Drag and drop the script in the screen, or us the .mcr script for a button (category jb_scripts).
